## 🚀 About Me

I'm building **Iris**, a Y Combinator-backed personal assistant. My work focuses on AI, systems design, and rapid prototyping, building end-to-end products from mobile experiences to scalable backend systems.

I've built **12+ consumer apps with over 10K users**, demonstrating expertise in full-stack development, mobile engineering, and product design.

I believe in continuously learning, iterating, and shipping things that have a real-world impact.
