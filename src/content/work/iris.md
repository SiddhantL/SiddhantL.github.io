Iris is an intelligent calendar and scheduling assistant that we're building to solve the constant friction of managing time in a world of endless meetings, emails, and context-switching. Backed by Y Combinator, Iris learns how you work and automates the tedious parts of time management through natural language commands.

Instead of manually dragging calendar blocks or crafting careful email replies, users can simply tell Iris what they need — "Reorganize my day to give me a slow start," "Reply to Sarah about the project update," or "Summarize my unread emails." The AI understands context, learns preferences, and handles the logistics while keeping everything private and secure.

## Technical Architecture

Leading the technical vision and architecture, we've built Iris mobile-first (available on iOS) with deep integrations into calendars, email, and meeting tools. Our technical stack combines natural language processing, user behavior modeling, and privacy-preserving design to create an assistant that truly understands how you work.

We emphasize privacy by design — end-to-end encryption, user-controlled data retention, and granular permissions ensure that sensitive information stays protected. This isn't just another AI chatbot; it's a context-aware assistant that becomes more valuable the more it learns about your workflow.

## The Journey

Building a YC-backed startup has been an intense journey for our team. From architecting scalable systems to designing intuitive user experiences, we're constantly pushing to ship something people genuinely need.
