Workspace was a freelance project that eventually evolved into my personal productivity hub. Built from scratch, it integrates a wide range of professional and creative workflows into a single seamless app experience.

Key features included a dedicated media hosting gallery, a blog writing and publishing tool, a project status tracker with taskboards and deadlines, a secure note-taking module, and even a dynamic resume editor to update CVs on the fly.

The backend leveraged Firebase for real-time data syncing, and the frontend was crafted with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility. The app was designed to feel as cohesive and integrated as tools like Notion or ClickUp but was custom-tailored to specific freelance and personal needs.

Building Workspace helped me sharpen my skills in full-stack app design, modular architecture, and UX optimization. It taught me how to structure large multi-module applications that stay flexible and scalable as requirements grow.
