FireStack is a productivity dashboard web app designed to help students manage their academic and career goals. It centralizes deadlines, to-dos, event calendars, and goal tracking into a responsive, easy-to-navigate interface.

The app was built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. I implemented full user auth, role-based access control, and modularized the backend into microservices — separating the calendar, notification, and task modules.

Students could create recurring deadlines, sync with external calendars, and get reminders before key events. The app also included a “career mode” feature with resume upload, interview tracker, and resource bookmarking.

This project improved my backend design chops, introduced me to event-driven architecture, and forced me to design for scale while retaining frontend responsiveness. It also helped me understand how to build platforms that users want to return to every day.
