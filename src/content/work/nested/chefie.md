Chefie was one of my earliest mobile app projects, developed and released independently on the Google Play Store nearly a decade ago. It was designed around a simple but powerful idea: help people cook with what they already have.

The app allowed users to input available ingredients at home and intelligently suggested matching recipes. It curated results by cross-referencing both in-app databases and online sources, displaying not just text instructions but also YouTube video tutorials for each dish.

Chefie’s backend was hosted on Firebase, which handled data storage and real-time syncing. I used native Android development (Java and XML) to ensure a smooth experience even on mid-range devices popular at the time.

Building Chefie taught me end-to-end app development, from backend integration to polished front-end UI. It was my first experience shipping a public-facing app, managing cloud-hosted data, and gathering user feedback through real-world deployment.
